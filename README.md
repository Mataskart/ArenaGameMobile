As you progress through the levels, the intensity ramps up, with hordes of enemies swarming around you, testing your reflexes and combat prowess to the limit. But watch out - as you climb higher, the enemies grow stronger and more cunning, requiring quick thinking and strategic use of your abilities to stay alive.
