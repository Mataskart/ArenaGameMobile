# Overview of the Technical Task

The technical task for "Arena Game" entails the creation of a 2D Unity game where players take control of a character to engage in combat against waves of enemies. Progression through the game is achieved by surviving against increasingly challenging waves of enemies, leading up to an ultimate boss fight.

![](https://i.imgur.com/gprniMV.jpeg)

Technical Requirements:

* Unity Game: The game is being developed using the Unity game engine, ensuring a robust and versatile development environment.
* 2D Gameplay: The gameplay experience is entirely in a 2D environment, offering a classic yet engaging gaming experience.
* Player Controls: Players navigate the game using simple controls, with movement facilitated by arrow keys and dashing enabled by a dedicated key (e.g., space). Attacks are executed using specific inputs, providing players with strategic combat options.
* Animations: The game incorporates animations for both the player character and enemies, enhancing the visual appeal and immersiveness of the gameplay. Multiple attack animations for the player character add depth to combat mechanics.
* Enemy Variety: To keep the gameplay dynamic and challenging, the game features six distinct types of enemies, each with unique behaviors and characteristics. As players progress through levels, they encounter increasingly formidable foes, ensuring continuous engagement and excitement.
* Boss Fight: The climax of the game is a thrilling boss fight, providing players with an ultimate challenge to overcome before achieving victory.
* Platform: The game targets PC desktop platforms, ensuring accessibility to a wide audience of gamers. Furthermore, the game is designed to be lightweight and does not require an internet connection, allowing for seamless offline gameplay.
* Compatibility: While the game is compatible with Windows 10 and Windows 11, it is not currently optimized for Linux systems.
* Future Considerations: In future iterations, there is a focus on improving script quality to enhance reusability and maintainability. Additionally, implementing dynamic level loading is a consideration to enhance gameplay variety and performance.

## Technology Stack

* Unity Version: The development of "Arena Game" is based on Unity 2022.3 LTS, providing stability and support for the latest features.
* Scripting Language: Game logic is implemented using C#, a powerful and versatile programming language that is well-suited for game development.
* Sprites: Player sprites are created using Photoshop, allowing for detailed and visually appealing character designs.
* GUI Elements: Graphical User Interface (GUI) elements are implemented using native HTML/CSS, ensuring consistency and flexibility in design.


### Player movement 
is implemented using Unity's input system, allowing for responsive and fluid control. The arrow keys are used for basic movement, providing players with precise control over their character's direction. Additionally, a dash mechanic is introduced to enhance player mobility and strategic maneuvering. Attacks are triggered using specific inputs, with animations corresponding to different attack actions.
Enemy Behavior

### Enemy behavior 
is governed by a combination of scripted AI logic and predefined patterns. Each enemy type exhibits unique movement patterns, attack behaviors, and vulnerabilities, requiring players to adapt their strategies accordingly. Enemy spawning is dynamically adjusted based on the player's progress and current level, ensuring a balanced and challenging experience.
Level Progression

### Levels 
in "Arena Game" are designed to progressively increase in difficulty, with each level introducing new enemy types and challenges. The game employs a wave-based spawning system, where enemies spawn in waves, with the intensity and frequency of enemy spawns ramping up as players advance through levels. Upon reaching the final level, players are confronted with a climactic boss fight, requiring mastery of gameplay mechanics and strategic thinking to emerge victorious.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Animations
One of the initial challenges encountered during development was implementing animations effectively within the game. While Unity's animation panel with transitions was initially explored, it was ultimately deemed unsuitable for the project's 2D nature. As a solution, animations are played through code scripts during initialization, providing greater control and flexibility over animation sequences and transitions.

### Level Design
Designing levels that offer a balanced and engaging gameplay experience posed another challenge. Initially, the concept of tracking enemy spawns and kills to determine level progression was considered. However, due to the complexity and scope of this approach, a time-based level progression system was adopted instead. Levels are timed, with progression based on surviving against waves of enemies within a specified time limit, ensuring a manageable and dynamic gameplay experience.

### Player Movement
Player movement mechanics underwent several iterations to achieve a satisfying and intuitive feel. While initially planned for basic movement controls using arrow keys or WASD, the addition of a dash mechanic was introduced to enhance player mobility and responsiveness. This addition not only provided players with more dynamic movement options but also contributed to the overall depth and excitement of gameplay.

## Looking ahead
There are several areas for potential improvement and expansion in "Arena Game." Enhancing script quality to improve reusability and maintainability is a priority, ensuring that the codebase remains flexible and scalable for future iterations. Additionally, implementing dynamic level loading and difficulty scaling is a consideration to further enhance gameplay variety, lots of bugs need fixing and the game is a demo in its current state with just the base functionality implemented. By continuously refining and expanding upon the foundation laid in the current iteration, "Arena Game" aims to provide players with an immersive and captivating gaming experience.
